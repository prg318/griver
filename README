NOTE:
This is an export of a google code repo from years ago.
I don't know where my iRiver H200 is so I have no interest in actively developing this project, but it should work for anyone that still have a working iRiver device that is compatible with libiriver.
Feel free to report any issues if anyone even has a working device anymore.

Requirements:
	Python 2.x (> 2.5)
	PyGTK 2.x
	libiriverdb (tested with 1.6)
		Website: http://bodgitandscarper.co.uk/libiriverdb/

Usage:
Run "griver.py" in with your python2 intrepreter to run griver:

	python2 ./griver.py
