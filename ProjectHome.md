## Project Information ##
Griver is a program that will create a tag database of files readable by the iRiver. It is compatible with both the H100 series and the H300 series. It is written in Python and uses the GTK2 user interface library.

To run Griver, [libiriverdb](http://bodgitandscarper.co.uk/libiriverdb/) is required.
